# NOBootstrap-responsive-page
# Coding Assignment

x. The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.

x. Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a `css` folder under the solution container folder, e.g., `module2-solution/css`.

x. You are NOT allowed to use any CSS (or Javascript) framework for this assignment, including Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework. No framework CSS files should even be referenced in your index.html, even if you are not using them. **However, you MAY use the simple responsive framework we developed in Lecture 24 as a starting point for this assignment.**

x. You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.

x. Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). 

x. Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.

10. Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself.

11. Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.

12. Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi)
